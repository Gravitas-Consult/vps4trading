                        VPS4TRADING.com exclusively uses top-of-the-line equipment from HP, Dell, Intel & IBM. By diversifying our hardware providers we significantly minimize any risk of hardware breakdown and thus guarantee you a VPS that is hosted on a powerful, reliable high-end server. Our servers are equipped with SSD RAID10 disk array built on high-performance SAS and SSD drives offering a high-speed access to information with a 10-20 times faster responding rate than most hosting providers using SATA drives. By using RAID10 array we ensure your virtual server data will be safe in the case of hard drive failure.
